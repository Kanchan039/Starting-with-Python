# Starting-with-Python
In this repository I will upload some of my projects with python

**So, 1st project is about making To Do List. With the help of this code you can make a list of your to Do works, and you can maintain it by marking Done or Not Done.**
After executing the code it will ask you to input the number between 1 to 5, as i have mentioned only 5 functions to do with this code. input of number other than 1-5 will lead to invalid choice of number.

Initially our To Do List will be empty. by choosing View task screen will look like:

Then we will add few tasks by choosing number 1 i.e. Add Task, and we will view added task by choosing number 3:

Now by choosing "Complete task", we will mark the task as done:

Hence, this is our program to make a TO DO LIST.


**2nd project is about generating a random password, with required criteria.**
After executing the code it will ask you to enter the length of password. According to our code if we enter length less than 6, then there will be no output.

Now, we will enter the required domain length, then the output is something like this:

Hence, this is our project to generate random password.

3rd project is about taking quiz.
After executing the code it will ask you the questions that we have mentioned in the code. According to our code the first Q. will be displayed as follows;

And if give wrong answer then output will be like:

After taking the quiz, our score will be displayed:

Hence, this is our project to display a quiz.

We can modify this program according to our need.
