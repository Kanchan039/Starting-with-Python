# Starting-with-Python
In this repository I will upload some of my projects with python

So, 1st project is about making To Do List. With the help of this code you can make a list of your to Do works, and you can maintain it by marking Done or Not Done.
After executing the code it will ask you to input the number between 1 to 5, as i have mentioned only 5 functions to do with this code. input of number other than 1-5 will lead to invalid choice of number.

Initially our To Do List will be empty. by choosing View task screen will look like:

Then we will add few tasks by choosing number 1 i.e. Add Task, and we will view added task by choosing number 3:

Now by choosing "Complete task", we will mark the task as done:

Hence, this is our program to make a TO DO LIST.

We can modify this program according to our need.
